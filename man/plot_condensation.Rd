\title{Plot dataframe condensation potential}
\usage{
plot_condensation(df, first = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{dataframe}

\item{first}{unquoted expression or string denoting the first variable to be
picked for condensation, Default: NULL}
}
\value{
ggplot2 plot
}
\description{
plotting the condensation potential is meant as a decision aid
  for which variables to include in an alluvial plot. All variables are
  transformed to categoric variables and then two variables are selected by
  which the dataframe will be grouped and summarized by. The pair that
  results in the greatest condensation of the original dataframe is selected.
  Then the next variable which offers the greatest condensation potential is
  chosen until all variables have been added. The condensation in percent is
  then plotted for each step along with the number of groups (flows) in the
  dataframe. By experience it is not advisable to have more than 1500 flows
  because then the alluvial plot will take a long time to render. If there is
  a particular variable of interest in the dataframe this variable can be
  chosen as a starting variable.
